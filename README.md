# Udacity-P6-Feedreader
Overview
Test-driven development is a great way to approach development. 

In this exercise, I was given an existing Feedreader application and my job was to use the Jasmine library to design tests that would make sure that -RSS Feeds were defined, had a url and had a name -The Menu was hidden by default and was visible when clicked -Initial entries could be loaded -Feeds would change their content when new content was loaded
