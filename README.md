# Udacity-P6-Feedreader
Overview
Test-driven development is a great way to approach development. 

In this project you are given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds.

Why this Project?

Testing is an important part of the development process and many organizations practice a standard of development known as "test-driven development". This is when developers write tests first, before they ever start developing their application. All the tests initially fail and then they start writing application code to make these tests pass.
